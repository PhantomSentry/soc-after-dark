 Why I Built This Project

I built **SOC After Dark** because most security labs don’t reflect how incidents actually happen in real environments.

In real SOC work:
- Alerts are noisy
- Logs are incomplete
- Controls fail quietly
- “Critical” findings are often not critical
- The hardest part is deciding **what matters**

Most CTFs focus on exploitation.
Most training focuses on tools.
Neither focuses enough on **judgment**.

This project exists to close that gap.
